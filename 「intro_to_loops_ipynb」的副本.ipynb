        "### **Introduction to Loops**\n",
        "\n",
        "In programming, loops offer a way to perform a set of instructions repeatedly. They are fundamental for tasks that require the same action to be taken on a series of items, or for actions to be repeated until a certain condition is met.\n",

        "### **Understanding the `while` Loop and its Applications**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Basic Syntax:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "while condition:\n",
        "    # body of the loop\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "count = 0\n",
        "while count < 5:\n",
        "    print(count)\n",
        "    count += 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above example, the loop will print numbers from 0 to 4. The loop continues as long as `count` is less than 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Applications:**\n",
        "1. **Repeating an action** until a user decides to quit.\n",
        "2. **Waiting for an external condition** to change (e.g., waiting for user input).\n",
